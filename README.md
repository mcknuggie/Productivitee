## Description

Productivitee is a chrome extension that allows the user to monitor exactly how long they are spending on unproductive websites. The extension can be interacted with by clicking on the icon in the top right hand corner of your chrome browser. When installed and switched on, the extension will begin tracking the amount of time the user spends on a list of "unproductive" websites. These websites include:

* youtube.com
* twitch.tv
* facebook.com
* netflix.com
* reddit.com
* hulu.com
* twitter.com
* buzzfeed.com
* disneyplus.com
* hbomax.com
* instagram.com
* tumblr.com
* tiktok.com

## Timer Popup

The timer popup screen displays how much time the user has spent on the website they are currently visiting. Note: It will not display the user's time on websites that are not listed above.

## Time Summary

At the bottom of the Timer popup screen there is a link that brings the user to their time summary screen. There, the user can get a summary of the time they have spent in total on unproductive websites. It also gives a breakdown of the exact amount of time spent on each unproductive website. The time summary will only display the unproductive sites they have actually spent time on.

## Setup

1. Download the zip file from gradescope and unzip. There should be a folder containing three .js files, two .html files, a .json file, a .css file, and an images folder.
2. Open your chrome browser and navigate to the Extension Management page. You can do this in one of two ways:

    * click the puzzle piece icon in the top right corner of your chrome browser. Then, click "Manage Extensions" at the bottom of the dropdown menu.

    * OR, you can go to chrome://extensions

3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner
4. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory you downloaded from gradescope.
5. (Optional) If the extension isn't working immediately, try clicking the reload icon inside the Productivitee extension box.

6. For quick access, you can pin the extension to your toolbar in the top right of your browser by clicking the puzzle piece in the top right, then clicking the pin icon next to Productivitee in the dropdown menu.

Great! Now, feel free to begin navigating to websites as you please. The Productivitee popup can be interacted with once you have navigated away from the Extension Manager page. It will begin counting once you navigate to a site it deems "unproductive". A list of "unproductive" websites can be seen above in the description of the extension.
